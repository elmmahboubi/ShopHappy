Unfortunately, I cannot directly create or add binary files like images. You'll need to:

1. Create a "public" folder in your project root if it doesn't exist
2. Save the Shop Happy logo image as "logo.png" in the public folder

The components have been updated to reference the logo at "/logo.png", which will work once you add the image file.
